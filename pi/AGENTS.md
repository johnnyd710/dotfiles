# Global AGENTS

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code (YAGNI).
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 2. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 3. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

## 4. Safety & Git Constraints
- **Never run an unscoped/global `find`** (e.g. `find / ...`, `find ~ ...`, or any `find` without a narrow, specific starting path). It scans the whole filesystem, is slow, and can hang/abort. Use `fffind`/`ffgrep` instead in a scoped directory.
- Ignore hidden files (`.obsidian`, `.trash`, etc.) unless requested.
- **Strictly local-only Git:** NEVER run `git push` or any command that affects remote repositories.
- Only run `git` commands that inspect the local repository, such as `git diff`, `git status`, or `git log`. Only run `git add` or `git commit` if given permission to do so.
- Never leave comments that reference details from chats but make very little sense in the context of reading it in the codebase.
